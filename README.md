  Working on an implementation of a neural network in an FPGA.  I am studying from"FPGA Implementations of Neural Networks", which is a collection of papers edited by Amos R. Omondi and Jagath C. Rajapakse.  A full citation is icluded below.

  The plan is to implement a NN in pyBrain, then attempt to implement the FPNA algorithm described in Omondi in python, then implement the algorithm on an FPGA using myHDL.
